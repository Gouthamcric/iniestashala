      <h1>How To Make a Resume?</h1><br>
      <h3>Follow the Steps :</h3>
      <p> internships are essential in shaping your initial career
         – the first step towards a work life and learning on the job.
         However, landing your dream internship isn’t as easy as it appears
         – courtesy intense competition. No matter how capable and qualified you are,
          your chances can often boil down to your first step
          – the intern resume.</p>
      <p><b>Step-1: <br>Contact details</b> – These form the heading of your resume and include your name, email id,
        phone number, and address. You can either use a large font for your name and list your contact details
         underneath it or use the same font for all the details.
         A few points to keep in mind while adding these details – </p>
      <p><b>Step-2:<br> Career Objective </b>-While the career statement forms an integral part of the resume, it shouldn’t be
        too long and unfocused.
        it could grab the attention of an employer to your application in the first 2 seconds.
        Include the skills you have that are required for the internship, your interest in the field, and what you can bring to
        the table.</p>
        <h4>Points to Remember:</h4>
  <p>    <ul>
        <li>Keep it concise.    </li>
        <li>Focus on your intern role rather than life goals.</li>
        <li>Focus on a bilateral goal and not just self serving.</li>
</ul>
</p>

      <p><b>Step-3:<br> Educational qualifications</b>- your educational degrees along with your institution, your aggregate
        percentage, and the (expected) year of graduation.
        Always follow the reverse chronological order, i.e. the most recent ones first.
      A brief table including your academic degrees and division should be sufficient to reflect your accolades.</p>
      <p><b>Step-4:<br> Skills</b>- State only similar skills your employer is looking for but use different words rather than
        choosing the same ones mentioned in the advertisement or internship post.When you are applying for an engineering internship, your technical skills are tantamount to your role.
        You can categorise your skills and use bullets to list them. </p>
        <p><b>Step-5:</b>
          <br><b>projects And Training</b> – As a college student, you work on various projects as a part of your course. These projects on your resume depict your conceptual knowledge and practical skills. Include the name of your project,
        a brief description of what it does and how it works, and mention your role in the project explicitly.
        Herein, you enlist all the certified trainings that you have taken up so far. These add credibility to your skills and signal the recruiter that you’re qualified enough to take up the job. If you haven’t done a
        substantial number of trainings, you can merge it with the ‘Work Experience’ section and name it ‘Internships and Trainings’.</p>


      <p><b>Step-6:</b><br><b>Experiance</b>- With the details of your previous internships, this section depicts your learning curve and displays how you’ve grown as a candidate.
         List the companies that you have worked for, the duration, and your profile.
       </p>

       <p><b>Step-7: <br>Additional details </b>– Your achievements and extra-curricular activities and acts as a saviour when you are taking your first step towards your career. Listing out the details of participation in various college events and competitions denote your holistic growth as a student and give the recruiter an insight into your talents
         and capabilities and a glimpse of your soft skills – confidence, emotional intelligence, teamwork, and dedication.</p>
